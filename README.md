# Quaternions---The-Right-Tetrahedron-Model
Quaternions have been overcomplicated; betraying their inherent simplicity. <br> 
The solution : to integrate my geometric model into its pedagogy -- allowing students to gain novel insight within its domain.

# The Right Tetrahedron

This is the base 3D shape that is used. <br>

# Explanation
Essentially the W dimension is the rotation density. Kind of similar to how you rotate around a point, because it does exactly that, except that its not a full 360 degrees, rather its been halved, into two parts, one 180 degrees and the other -180, or 1 and -1, 

where x y z are vectors, w is the scalar component. 

0.5, 1, -0.5, -1
